## Project Experience

* 2019.6 - 2019.8, [Ancient Poem Game Module in Benben Wechat Official Account](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/2Zm4-xkUq_A3d0qjn1FN_Q) 
Benben is an intelligent chatting virtual robot developed by SCIR lab, HIT and this game enables Benben to interact with users in 5 poem games. It would generate questions from database and require users to input answers to continue games. In some modules, Benben and users would need to input poem sentences in required format in turn, a way to test usersâ€™ proficiency in Chinese Poems.

## Other
I hope my exchange life in NCTU not only consist of courses-studying but also some participation in lab, which would help me to feel the academic atmosphere here more comprehensively. Also I want to improve my research skills to gain more advantages when applying for good graduate programs in the future.
